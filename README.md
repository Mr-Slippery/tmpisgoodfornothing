# Template Metaprogramming Is Good for Nothing

## Repo contents

* a very basic header-only template metaprogramming library created to learn TMP;
* a companion static-test executable.

## The name

The name was suggested by Grațiela Ghergu ([fieryjoy](https://github.com/fieryjoy)) based on the statement of Kōdō Sawaki Roshi, popularized by Shōhaku Okumura, that "zazen is good for nothing".

This indeed seems to apply to this library, but even in general to pure template metaprograms to some degree, because the runtime does literally nothing.
